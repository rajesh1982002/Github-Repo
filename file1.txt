Wendy Williams is feeling her oats and returning to her 'mean girl ways' now that her talk show has been renewed.

At the end of last season, viewers saw a kinder, gentler Wendy as she struggled with alcohol abuse and her marriage to cheating husband Kevin Hunter. The future of the show was in question and viewers responded to the more sympathetic side of Wendy.

But insiders tell DailyMailTV Williams's daytime talk show is now struggling to book high profile guests after the TV host appeared to slip back into her old habits during the premiere of its 11th season.

The 55-year-old told viewers during the September 16 episode production company Debmar-Mercury has renewed her show through 2022 - prompting cheers from the crowd and a confetti celebration.   

But sources behind the scenes say Williams's new job security has brought back her shady side as viewers saw her drop her 'girl next door act' and take jabs at her own friends and colleagues on air.

Following a tumultuous year, the 55-year-old gossip maven appears to be back to her old self, as the show's season premiere saw Wendy take jabs at her friends and colleagues 

Early into her hot topics segment, she took aim at her former guest host Jerry O'Connell offering her condolences after his summer talk show test run did not get picked up by a network.

She was later interrupted by her producer who told her executives called in to say they are 'still trying to sell the show' and that it wasn't dead yet. 

Williams apologized for the mix-up and quickly moved on. 

An insider said: 'She knew good and well what the hell she was doing. 

'Once Wendy got her green light to return for two more seasons, she didn't have to play nice any longer and pretend she was onboard with Jerry's show being her sibling show. 

'She always believed her executives were trying to groom Jerry to replace her and that pretend mix-up she did on air was her Wendy way of sabotaging Jerry.'  

Earlier this year Williams's troubles made international headlines and the outpouring of support from fans and celebrities alike had the gossip maven on a different path - a direction that producers and executives at her show hoped would be a new chapter after all she had endured. 

In fact, viewers responded positively to her upbeat hot topics segments in which she often spoke about her new life as a single woman.

'It was the new and improved Wendy Williams. She was fun and likable and the viewers loved the new Sex in the City edition of the Wendy Williams Show,' the source said. 

'She came across lighter and carefree and the happier she appeared, the more people responded to it.' 

However, the source revealed there was a lot of 'uncertainty' about the show's future at the end of season 10 due to Williams's personal troubles and she was worried it could get the ax.   

'The truth is, Wendy was very nervous that the network was going to cancel her because of how messy her real life had become,' the source continued.

'She had lost sobriety, lost her husband, lost the family life she worked so hard to build; but the last thing Wendy wanted to lose was her beloved TV show. '

Williams really became concerned when her comedy tour during the show's hiatus in August tanked. 

The tour's first date in Oakland went well in July; but the August dates for the Wendy Williams & Friends Tour in Atlanta, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Detroit, and even Williams' home state of New Jersey in Newark were all canceled due to poor ticket sales.

'Wendy was devastated. She felt like her brand was taking a hit because of her personal life and it was ruining her other business ventures. She also thought the impression that she could no longer sell tickets to events would be another reason the producers of her talk show may cut their losses with her and end the show.'

During the premiere episode, Williams also ruffled some feathers by accusing supermodel Christie Brinkley of faking her arm injury on Dancing with Stars in an attempt to make her model daughter, Sailor Brinkley-Cook a big star.  

She said the fall looked 'fake as hell,' despite statements from BBC Studios and ABC saying Brinkley had to undergo surgery for her wrist and arm and even have a rod inserted.

In an interview with People, Brinkley responded to the comments saying she was 'really stunned' at her friend's remarks, before reportedly breaking down in tears.  

'I'm totally shocked, because I have been there for Wendy Williams. That is so weird,' she said. 

Last week, Brinkley appeared on The Talk saying she had helped Williams overcome a bout with stage freight and had been aiding her in her ongoing divorce.

'My message to Wendy is: It's so much more fun to be kind. Try it,' Brinkley said on The Talk. 'It can't feel good to try to hurt other people. If it feels good, something's seriously wrong.'

The Talk co-hosts Sheryl Underwood and Sharon Osbourne also weighed in, reminding her that she wasn't too far removed from her own personal drama and how people were supportive of her.

'Why does she have to be so mean?' Osbourne asked.

Underwood added: 'Nobody said when she was going through the stuff she was going through that she was faking it. We all were worried about her health. 

On the mend: Brinkley said doctors 'ended up putting in a plate' in her arm to stabilize injuries she suffered in rehearsals	+8

'So we want to say as women, Wendy, don't go back to what you used to be... God gave you a second chance. Don't do this, don't do this. We love Wendy Williams, and we thought you were gonna come back around as another person.' 

And they weren't the only talk show hosts sounding off on Williams either. 

Loni Love and Tamera Mowry-Housley at The Real were upset after Williams took jabs at them during an interview with their former co-host Tamar Braxton. 

During her September 18 show, Williams dismissed The Real as 'a cute show' that really needed Braxton back.

'Thanks for calling us a "cute show" Wendy. We're also an Emmy-winning show,' Love shot back in a dig at Williams whose show has only been nominated in its 11-year run.

Mowry-Housley added: 'It's time for me to say this. It's time for women of color to stop putting each other down. We already have other people doing that. More importantly, it, start uplifting each other. Loving each other.'

Producers at Williams' show say that backlash for the comments about Brinkley, being called out by the ladies of The Talk, her new feud with the women on The Real and even the perception of her comments about O'Connell's show is making it tough to book top tier guests.

'There's always been a segment of Hollywood stars who would never come on Wendy's show. There are still a lot of big name black stars in particular who made a vow a decade ago to never appear on her show based on things she said about them doing her radio days. 

'But just when we thought things would be easier for getting guests and engaging people who aren't just reality stars and B-players in sitcoms and movies, she's making it hard again,' the source concluded.

While the network may be frustrated that they won't be getting any high profile guests this season, they are hopeful they can make it through season 11 without all of the personal drama that plagued Williams throughout season 10.
