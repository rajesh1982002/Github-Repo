5.0 out of 5 starsWell balanced sounding earphones along with light, durable and long battery life
July 29, 2019
Color: Black/RedVerified Purchase
I bought this Bluetooth earphones for my daily workout inside and outside. The earphones fit well as I move around during my workout (sprinting, running, exercising etc...). I've tried similar earphones with similar price points in the past. And, the overall sound quality is well balanced from bass, mid to treble all across compared to others. I liked the light weight element of this product for my purpose and liked the sound quality. The battery life went about 16 hours after fully charged which is great. I played fairly loud music. Setting up initially was easy without any issue as you would expect from other BT devices. Mic seems to be working in good quality as I tested with a call with my friend. Noise cancelling is effective with the provided ear tips. BT range is 33ft which I expect to be little longer as it's BT 5.0, but 33ft is still good for my purpose. This comes with a 1 year warranty so you are worry-free. Overall, this product is an excellent buy if you are looking for a reasonable price with good quality sports earphones!

5.0 out of 5 starssuper cool and functional earphones
August 16, 2019
Color: Black/RedVerified Purchase
I bought this for my nephew as he said he loves using his air pods everywhere but really doesnâ€™t want to lose them while running and asks me if I can help him. As a great auntie, what can I do? Say no? Of course not, I immediately did some research and found this pair. I admit that I do like the red and black color combo and the futuristic design remind me that famous pricey big name which my nephew actually likes that brand too. After using for almost 2 weeks, surprisingly he called me and sent me pictures to update the status of earphones. He said the earphones fit well as he moves around during his workout/ exercises or running on the platform to catch his train. He likes the overall sound quality and even feels the bass response is actually better which he believes the earphones sit within his ears better than the originals. He did answer phone calls a couple of times and said the mic is in a good quality. Overall, he really like the earphones as they are great for any activities with a lot of motions, sweat or rain but amazingly stay put, and wonâ€™t get lost nowhere and effortlessly rest on your neck.

5.0 out of 5 starsawsome deep bass, good for exercising
August 24, 2019
Color: Black/RedVerified Purchase
I used to wear the true wireless earbud during running and found myself dropping the earbud couple times. This headphone are the better alternative when I'm exercising.

Pros:
Sound quality is very good. Deep bass is well reflected.
Elegant design: most the weight is on the body and sits on the neck. The earbud itself is light so it's comfortable to wear. I can easily take one side off when I need to listen to something (eg, crossing street, or talking to some one).
Great battery life. I haven't charged it for 4 days and still 50% left.

Cons:
Micro usb instead of usb c. And there's only 1 color to choose from.

5.0 out of 5 starsLong battery life!
September 24, 2019
Color: Black/RedVerified Purchase
Sound quality: good for the price. I mean, it's not a $300 pair of headphones. So for $20, sound is decent, good enough for everyday listening. Bass is strong if you use the right ear tip size to achieve a good seal. Clarity is good too. Sound stage is ok, typical with in ear headphones.
Battery life: this is the highlight for this product. While most wireless BT headphones offer 6-8 hours of listening per charge and require almost daily charge, this one claims up to 24 hours of battery life. I haven't done a stress test, but with my typical listening style (I make a lot of phone calls and listen to a couple hours of music every day), the first full charge of battery lasted around 6 days (I turned them off at night). I was expecting 3 days. So it totally exceeded my expectations.
Others: BT connectivity is stable, never had a drop. Microphone calling quality is good too. It doesn't have noise cancellation, more of a noise isolation. All in all, a good pair of BT headphones with long battery life.

5.0 out of 5 starsThe best buds I owned!
September 25, 2019
Color: Black/RedVerified Purchase
Oh my God!!!! I'm being a little emotional right now, so Iâ€™ll try to calm down.... woh... So, I received these headphones today. It was well packed and I felt in loved with it right away. I charged the headphones according to the guide, and it connected to my iPhone right away. But a little later, when I put it in my ears and turned on the recording I listened earlier today, I fell in a pleasure of excitement!!! All day I did listen to a very important for me lecture of someone I respect a lot, and may even say, adore, but only with these earbuds I got a very clear sound, much louder than with the old earbuds I owned (I wonâ€™t tell you the brand name just cause I respect that brand). But really!! The sound is just perfect! The buds block outer noises completely! And magnets on the back of the buds keep them stuck together, and very convenient to carry around. And one more thing I just remembered... My ear halls are quite small and itâ€™s hard for me to find buds that comfortably fit them. But these buds are just perfect, as I already said! Woh... still trying to calm down. ;)
PS: there is one thing I want to add. I like the fact, that I could connect 2 devices to these earphones at the same time! It is very convenient to me, because if I watch something on my IPad I can answer the phone if someone is calling, and donâ€™t miss it if I listen to a loud music! :)
